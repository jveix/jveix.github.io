This is a poster presented in the [UAE Microbiome 2023](https://www.uaemicrobiome2023.org/) conference organized by the United Arab Emirates University on november 21 and 22. The topic was part of my advances in my Ph.D. project, about how the metabolites and microbiota are vertically transmitted from mothers to their newborns. The complete work will be published as a paper, hopefully next year, when it's fully completed.

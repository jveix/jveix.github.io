Mammary gland secretory cells produce miRNA-rich milk. In humans, these miRNAs reach infant/neonate bloodstream, playing diverse roles, like neural system development, metabolism, and immune system maturation. Notwithstanding, still few works explore human milk miRNA content, and there are no reports at the population level. Our hypothesis was that miR-146b-5p, miR148a-3p, miR155-5p, mir181a-5p, and mir200a-3p immunoregulatory miRNAs are expressed in human colostrum/milk at a higher level than infant milk formulae. The aim of this work was to evaluate the expression of the five immunoregulatory miRNAs in human milk and compare it with their expression in infant milk formula. For this purpose, miRNA relative expression was measured by qPCR in cDNA prepared from total RNA extracted from sixty human colostrum/milk samples and six different formulae. The comparative Cт method 2−ΔCт using exogenous cel-miR-39 as internal control was employed, followed by statistical analysis. We found the relative expression levels of miRNAs are comparable among colostrum/milk samples, and these miRNAs are present in infant milk formulae but at very low concentrations. We conclude that the relative expression of the immunomodulatory miRNAs is comparable in all the human colostrum/milk samples and is higher than the expression in formulae.

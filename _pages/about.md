I'm a young emerging researcher passionate for microbiota and data science. My journey into the world of scientific inquiry and exploration commenced with a childhood fascination for the intricate workings of the natural world. Books and literature, along with an early affinity and passion for computers during adolescence, have been influential guides throughout my life. Motivated by works such as Desmond Morris's "The Human Zoo" and Richard Dawkins's "The Selfish Gene," my interest in life studies blossomed. These literary journeys ignited a curiosity that would later become a driving force in my academic pursuits, while I still continued to dive into the world of Python programming and GNU/Linux.

My formal academic journey began at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City, where I pursued my Bachelor of Science degree in Biology. Here, the world of organic life forms unfolded before me, and the pages of Lynn Margulis's "Microcosmos" further fueled my fascination, particularly with the microscopic organisms. This deep connection with the tiniest aspects of life laid the foundation for my future specialization in Microbiology.

For my postgraduate studies, I applied for the Master's Program in Genetics and Molecular Biology at The Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (CINVESTAV), Zacatenco, where I delved even deeper into the mysteries of microbiology. Beyond the confines of traditional academia, I dedicated myself to honing skills in data science, recognizing its pivotal role in advancing microbiota research. Staying abreast of cutting-edge developments in both biology and data science, I witnessed the synergy between these disciplines.

My academic development is a merge of science, literature, and code. This interdisciplinary approach has proven both successful and exhilarating, allowing me to explore the mysteries that captivated my younger self. In the current scientific landscape, the interplay between massive data generation and sophisticated analytical tools has become indispensable as new challanges continue emerging in the field of life sciences.
